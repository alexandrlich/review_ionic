		<h4><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></h4>
		<p>
			You and Reviyou agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>“) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. <strong>You acknowledge and agree that you and Reviyou are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding</strong>. Further, unless both you and Reviyou otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.<br>
			 Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>“) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a title="www.adr.org/arb_med" href="www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.<br>
			 Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for California residents.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.<br>
			 Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Reviyou otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Reviyou submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.<br>
			 Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Reviyou will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.<br>
			 Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Reviyou will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).<br>
			 Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if Reviyou changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a title="legal@reviyou.com" href="mailto:legal@reviyou.com?subject=dispute">legal@reviyou.com</a> within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of Reviyou’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Reviyou in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
		</p>
		<h4><strong>General</strong></h4>
		<p>
			The failure of Reviyou to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.

Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

			 Reviyou Inc. (“<strong>Reviyou</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>“) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users on (i) our proprietary software app for mobile devices (the “<strong>App</strong>“) and (ii) the Reviyou website available at <a title="www.reviyou.com" href="https://www.reviyou.com">www.reviyou.com</a> (together with its sub-domains, content, and services, the “<strong>Site</strong>“). The App and Site are collectively referred to herein as the “<strong>Services</strong>“.<br>
			 This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site or via the App. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. This Privacy Policy forms a part of the Reviyou Terms of Service available at <a title="reviyou.com/terms_and_privacy" href="http://reviyou.com/terms_and_privacy">reviyou.com/terms_and_privacy</a> (the “<strong>Terms</strong>“). Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in the Terms.<br>
			 As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
		</p>
		<h4><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></h4>
		<p>
			Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, features and content and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Services.<br>
			<em>Personally Identifiable Information.</em><br>
			 In order to access certain features of the Services, you must register to create an Account. In order to create your Account to use the Services, we will collect certain Personal Information (defined below) from you. You may register directly via the App (if you have downloaded the App by logging into your account with certain third party SNSs via the App, as described herein. If you decide to register through an SNS, we will extract the Personal Information and other information you have provided to the SNS, (i) such as your “real” name and email address and (ii) certain other information you make publicly available via the SNS from the account you have with the applicable SNS and use that information to create your Account. The specific information that we extract may depend on the privacy settings you or your SNS friends have with the SNS. By “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” we mean information about you that can be used to contact or identify you. Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name and your email We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries. The specific information that we extract may depend on the privacy settings you and your SNS friends have with the SNS. For certain SNSs through which you may choose to register, a pop-up box may appear as part of the Account registration process which you will need to approve in order to proceed, and which will describe the types of personal information that we will obtain from, and the types of activities that we or you may perform in connection with, your account on such SNS. You hereby consent to our access to and collection of personal information about you that we obtain from the applicable SNS, which access and use shall be in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, you hereby agree that we may continue to access and use such personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy in the event the Reviyou Services no longer use the SNS platform through which we obtained such information or if your Reviyou Account otherwise ceases to be linked to your SNS account.<br>
			 We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your Account (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own), age, gender and individual preferences) (“<strong>Non-Identifying Information</strong>“).<br>
			 Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Reviyou Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Services . We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.<br>
			 We may also use your Personal Information to contact you with Reviyou newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your “Settings” information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information” below.<br>
			<em>Log Data.</em> When you visit the Services, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “<strong>Reviyou User</strong>“), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends (“<strong>Log Data</strong>“). This Log Data may include information such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site and App that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site and App, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for technical administration of the Services, to increase functionality and user-friendliness of the Services, and to better tailor them to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site or App again, it will recognize you and potentially serve advertisements, content, and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site and users of the App meet the criteria required to process their requests.

		<h4><strong>Cookies</strong></h4>
		<p>
			Like many web-based product, we use “cookies” on the Site to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Services. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services, and to monitor aggregate usage by Reviyou Users and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services, and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Services.
		</p>
		<h4><strong>Web Beacons</strong></h4>
		<p>
			We also use “web beacons,” “pixel tags,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “<strong>Web Beacons</strong>“) on our Services. A Web Beacon is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on web pages. Web Beacons are ordinarily not visible to users. Web Beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Services to deliver branded services and to generate statistics about how our Services are used.
		</p>
		<h4><strong>Inviting Friends to use the Services</strong></h4>
		<p>
			As part of the Services, Members may invite non-registered users to use Services through use of their Accounts. Where a Member selects the option of adding one or more email addresses, SNS contacts or mobile telephone numbers to an online form, the message such Member creates in the corresponding template will be sent by us to those email addresses, SNS contacts or mobile telephone numbers on the Member’s behalf. These email addresses, SNS contacts and mobile telephone numbers will be used only for the purpose of sending the email, SNS communication or text message communication to the addressee.
		</p>
		<h4><strong>Phishing</strong></h4>
		<p>
			Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Reviyou. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.

For example, Reviyou may share Member Content such as comments and feedback from friends (with individual identifying information removed) with third parties or provide or license such Member Content to third parties in order to promote the Services.<br>
			<em>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</em> We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes.

		</p>

		<p>
			Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.

If you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

We may allow third parties, such as companies that provide us with analytics tools, to collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different web sites when a consumer uses the Services.
